# Module 4 <small>Add a vulnerability scanning stage</small>

Attendees will learn about the security considerations around building container images and then apply those learnings by embedding security testing into a CI/CD pipeline that's used for building, shipping, and deploying a container based application. They will get hands-on experience integrating security testing such as static analysis of Dockerfiles and application code, vulnerability assessments of images, and signing of images using a variety of open source projects. At the end of the workshop they'll have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with embedded security testing that they can use to deploy an application.
