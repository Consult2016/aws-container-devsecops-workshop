Learn about a variety of patterns for integrating security testing and security-centric release control into AWS CodePipeline. Additionally, learn how to add feedback loops and fix common security vulnerabilities in your container-based application. Level : Advanced Duration : 2 - 3 hours Prerequisites : AWS Account, Admin IAM User CSF Functions : Prevent, Detect CAF Components : Preventative, Detective AWS Services : Amazon CloudWatch , AWS CodeCommit , AWS CodeBuild , AWS CodePipeline , Amazon ECR , AWS Lambda , and AWS Security Hub Open Source Projects : Hadolint , Trufflehog , and Anchore Scenario Your company has just kicked off a new DevSecOps initiative in an effort to improve the security of critical applications by embedding security in every part of the software development lifecycle. You are part of a DevOps team tasked with integrating security testing into a rudimentary pipeline for building and releasing container images. Your initial tasks include adding in Dockerfile linting, secrets scanning, and vulnerability scanning. The decision has been made to evaluate and make use of open source projects with the possibility of moving to a commercial offering based on how well the requirements are met. Architecture For this workshop you will start with a basic CI/CD pipeline that is triggered on Pull Requests and builds and pushes a container image to an Amazon ECR repository. As you work through the tasks in your latest sprint you'll end up with the CI/CD/pipelin as shown below. It will include stages with in your AWS CodePipeline for linting Dockerfiles, scanning for secrets, and scanning for vulnerabilities including integration with AWS Security Hub. In addition you will be using a combination of Amazon CloudWatch Event Rules and Lambda Functions to create feedback loops for each stage of security testing you create. This will allow your developers to quickly fix and iterate on their code which will lead to faster and more secure delivery.

This module requires you to run two separate AWS CloudFormation templates which will automate the creation of the pipeline and Anchore service. You will then walk through each stage and manually configure the security testing. Deploy the Anchore service The first CloudFormation you run will create the Anchore vulnerability scanning service. Before you deploy the CloudFormation template feel free to view it here . Region Deploy US East 2 (Ohio) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template. On the Specify Details click Next . Once you have entered your parameters click Next , then Next again (leave everything on this page at the default). Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles and CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND and click Create . This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE status. Deploy your pipeline The second CloudFormation you run will create the initial pipeline. Before you deploy the CloudFormation template feel free to view it here . Region Deploy US East 2 (Ohio) Click the Deploy to AWS button above. This will automatically take you to the console to run the template.

Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a CREATE_COMPLETE status. Browse to your Cloud9 IDE You will be doing the majority of the workshop using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) within AWS Cloud9 , a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. Open the AWS Cloud9 console (us-east-2) Click Open IDE in the container-devsecops-wksp-ide environment. This will take you to your IDE in a new tab. Always keep this tab open To make life easier on yourself, always keep your IDE tab open and use a different tab for all other activities. Test your pipeline Now you can test your pipeline to see how your Pull Requests result with an image being built and pushed to AWS ECR . Within your Cloud9 IDE expand your sample application on the left side. Open the Dockerfile . Add a name to the maintainer line. Push your commit and create a Pull Request. cd sample-application/ git add Dockerfile git commit -m Modified Maintainer in Dockerfile git push -u origin development aws codecommit create-pull-request --title Updated Maintainer --description Please review these changes. --targets repositoryName=container-devsecops-wksp-app,sourceReference=development,destinationReference=master You can browse to AWS CodePipeline to view your code progress through the pipeline.

Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community. Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution. Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features. When filing an issue, please check existing open , or recently closed , issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful: A reproducible test case or series of steps The version of our code being used Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug Anything unusual about your environment or deployment Contributing via Pull Requests Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that: You are working against the latest source on the master branch. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted. To send us a pull request, please: Fork the repository. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change. Ensure local tests pass. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation. GitHub provides additional document on forking a repository and creating a pull request . Finding contributions to work on Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels ((enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start. Code of Conduct This project has adopted the Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct . For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional questions or comments. Security issue notifications If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page . Please do not create a public github issue. Licensing See the LICENSE file for our project's licensing. We will ask you to confirm the licensing of your contribution. We may ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for larger changes.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contribute/#contributing-guidelines","text":"Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project.
